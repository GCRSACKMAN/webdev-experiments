    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This jam is a traditional topping for the Polish mazurek, but can be used as a generic sweet spread.   </p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium sized oranges</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Zest all fruit.</li>
        <li>Peel off the albedo (the white part under the skin).</li>
        <li>Blend the fruit (not too much, it doesn't need to become an even mush, just cut up into small pieces).        </li>
        <li>Combine the blended fruit, zest, and sugar in a pot.</li>
        <li>Bring to boil and boil for 30-40 minutes on low heat. The mixture will thicken as water evaporates. Note that it will thicken even further once it cools, so donâ€™t boil for too long - it is expected to be still a little runny at the end of boiling.
        </li>   
    </ol>
